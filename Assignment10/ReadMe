Got it to work

Here are my steps 

Step 1: I made sure I was in the root directory for the class. so my <C:Users\Michelle\Documents\GitHub\spring2021-mobile-development>

Step 2 : I had to check the status of the entire directory and not just my Assignment10 by typing <git status> in my <\spring2021-mobile-development> repo.

Step 3: It told me I had my Assignment10 as an untracked file so I had to <get add> .

Step 4 : It then told me that my origin/main had diverged and I had to <get pull>
